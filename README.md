# Cycle-GAN
A Generative Adversarial Network for converting Horse into Zebra.

Hey Guys,
I have Highly refered to [tensorflow website on cycleGAN](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cyclegan),

I have done a few modification like building a different Generator & discriminator. 
The Discriminator uses VGG network.

Since my GPU runs out of memory I have resized the images to work with shape (100, 100, 3)
